It is simple, like sending a message to a friend on Telegram. No extra application is installed, but it can work on multiple platforms, desktops, and mobiles (like Telegram ðŸ˜Š)

## Usage

### Expense loggin

Send a message in the configured group with the format.

```
<expense subject: string> <amount: float><transaction_type:enum(â€˜â€™, â€˜câ€™)>

Debit expense:
